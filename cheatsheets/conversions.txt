Tip: Converting Between Datatypes
Sometimes you might need to convert between different data types in Python for one reason or another.
That is very easy to do:

From tuple to list:

>>> cool_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
>>> cool_list = list(cool_tuple)
>>> cool_list
[1, 2, 3]


From list to tuple:

>>> cool_list = [1, 2, 3]
>>> cool_tuple = tuple(cool_list)
>>> cool_tuple
(1, 2, 3)


From string to list:

>>> cool_string = "Hello"
>>> cool_list = list(cool_string)
>>> cool_list
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']


From list to string:

>>> cool_list = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
>>> cool_string = str.join("", cool_list)
>>> cool_string
'Hello'
As can be seen above, converting a list into a string is more complex. Here str() is not sufficient.
 We need str.join(). 
 Try running the code above again, but this time using str.join("---", cool_list) in the second line. 
 You will understand how str.join() works.

***
cool_string = str.join(",",cool_list)
output- 'H,e,l,l,o'
