Dictionary Loop and String Formatting
Here is an example that combines a dictionary loop with string formatting. The loop iterates over the dictionary and it generates and prints out a string in each iteration:



phone_numbers = {"John": "+37682929928", "Marry": "+423998200919"}
 
for pair in phone_numbers.items():
    print(f"{pair[0]} has as phone number {pair[1]}")


And here is a better way to achieve the same results by iterating over keys and values:

phone_numbers = {"John": "+37682929928", "Marry": "+423998200919"}
 
for key, value in phone_numbers.items():
    print(f"{key} has as phone number {value}")


In both cases, the output is:

John has as phone number +37682929928

Marry has as phone number +423998200919
